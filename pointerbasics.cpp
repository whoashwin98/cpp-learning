// pointer basics in CPP
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// problems with pointers:
// 1. null pointer dereferencing - this happens when you try to derefrence some pointer which has a NULL value.
// 2. memory leaks - this happens when we do not de-allocate the memory we have allocated dynamically (may cause problems on a larger scale)
// 3. dangling pointer - this happens when the pointer is made to point to a location which gets de-allocated during execution.
// 4. double free - happens when the free or delete function is called multiple times with the same memory address.

// lvalues and rvalues: 

int main() {
    return 0;
}
